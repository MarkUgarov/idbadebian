# idbadebian
An attempt to create a biobox allowing to use idba. This was implemented based on nucleotid.es to solve rfc IDBA Assembler Biobox #115. It uses a docker with debian. 
Attempts to use the idba-version included in "universe" failed while running idba with testdata. 
This is my first biobox. Please be kind.
